# Connections between SMART, INVEST, DoR, and DoD in Project Management

In project management, the concepts of **SMART**, **INVEST**, **DoR (Definition of Ready)**, and **DoD (Definition of Done)** are interconnected. They help ensure clarity, quality, and success in project delivery.

These four concepts complement each other in a project, from clear goal-setting (SMART and INVEST) to ensuring the work starts with clarity (DoR) and finishes with value delivered and quality assured (DoD).

Here's how these concepts relate to one another:

## 1. SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)

SMART is a technique used to define clear and measurable objectives. In projects, SMART goals ensure that objectives are well-defined, realistic, and time-bound.

### SMART Breakdown:

- **Specific**: The objective should be clear and precise.
- **Measurable**: There should be criteria to track progress.
- **Achievable**: The goal should be realistic and attainable.
- **Relevant**: It should be relevant to the project’s overarching goals.
- **Time-bound**: There should be a deadline to achieve the objective.

### Example of SMART Goal:

"Increase website traffic by 20% over the next 3 months by optimizing SEO and creating 10 new blog posts."

This is:

- **Specific**: Focused on increasing website traffic.
- **Measurable**: The increase is quantifiable (20%).
- **Achievable**: Given the resources, it’s feasible.
- **Relevant**: Tied to marketing efforts.
- **Time-bound**: Limited to 3 months.

## 2. INVEST (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)

INVEST is an acronym used to describe best practices in creating user stories in Agile methodologies like Scrum. For a user story to be effective, it should meet the following criteria:

### INVEST Breakdown:

- **Independent**: The story can be developed without depending on others.
- **Negotiable**: The scope should be flexible and adaptable.
- **Valuable**: It should deliver value to the end user.
- **Estimable**: It should be possible to estimate the effort required.
- **Small**: The story should be small enough to be completed within an iteration.
- **Testable**: It should be possible to test whether the story has been implemented correctly.

### Example of INVEST User Story:

"As a user, I want to reset my password via email, so I can regain access to my account if I forget it."

- **Independent**: This feature can be developed without impacting others.
- **Negotiable**: The method (via email) can be discussed.
- **Valuable**: Provides clear value to the user.
- **Estimable**: Effort can be estimated based on similar tasks.
- **Small**: Can be implemented in a short period.
- **Testable**: Can be tested through different email clients and scenarios.

## 3. DoR (Definition of Ready)

DoR is a set of criteria that a user story or task must meet before it’s considered "ready" for development. It ensures that the team has enough information to start work.

### DoR and Its Relationship with INVEST:

- **Estimable**: The task must be estimable, meaning the team should understand the effort required.
- **Negotiable & Independent**: The task should be flexible in scope but clear in its dependencies (or lack thereof).

### Example of DoR Criteria:

- The story has acceptance criteria.
- The story is small enough to be completed within one sprint.
- The team understands the story’s business value.

## 4. DoD (Definition of Done)

DoD outlines the criteria that a user story or task must meet to be considered "done" or complete. It ensures quality by confirming that all aspects of the task have been fulfilled.

### DoD and Its Relationship with SMART and INVEST:

- **Specific & Measurable**: The task must meet specific and measurable quality standards.
- **Testable**: The task must pass all tests before it is considered complete.

### Example of DoD Criteria:

- Code has been peer-reviewed.
- Unit tests are written and pass.
- The feature has been deployed to the staging environment and approved by the product owner.

## Connections and Synergy:

- **SMART** is more focused on project-wide goals, while **INVEST** focuses on the development of user stories and clear requirements. Both depend on having well-defined scope and clear objectives.
- **DoR** and **DoD** ensure quality throughout the development cycle, making sure the work is clear enough to start and only considered done when it meets defined quality standards.
